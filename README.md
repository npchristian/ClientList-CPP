# ClientList-CPP
This is unfinished/in development. Project began on 9/27/19.

The intent is to practice CPP and develop a database which stores customers. An order can be sent to shipping with the customer's name, address, and quantity to be purchased. 

Current issues are:
  1. Infinite loop in for loop inside the getCust function
  2. issues with symbols printing where customer information should be printed (example: @%@# etc. )
